               <p>
               In order for Axie Infinity to reach our second, third, and fourth-degree connections (the friends and family of our friends and family) Axie needs a long term solution that makes participating in the Axie game & economy, fast, cheap, and seamless. We need it to be fun and easy!
                </p>
                <p>
                Ronin comes with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                  Fast & seamless transactions with almost instant confirmation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Drastically reduced gas fees. In addition, rather than paying Ethereum miners â€” the gas fees could be retained by the community and used for things like tournaments & bounties.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  The ability to withdraw Axie assets back to Ethereum Mainnet.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  Simplified on-boarding for new users, through a customized wallet solution.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  A block explorer for transparency and data accessibility.
                  </li>
                </ul>
